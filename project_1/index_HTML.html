            Howdy! My name is Evan, I'm from Sugar Land, TX, and I'm studying Computer Engineering at Texas A&M
            University
        </p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Born in Houston and raised in Sugar Land, I grew up learning how to work with technology in and
                        out of school, eventually leading me to come to Texas A&M where I ended up deciding to pursue a
                        degree in computer engineering. My first true exposure to the field was when I upgraded my first
                        desktop tower, swapping from a hard drive to a solid state drive to complement the already
                        decent graphics card. I learned a lot about computers in the process, and was rewarded with a
                        fast performing PC which started my interest in making computers.

                <li>
                    <p>Throughout the entirety of middle school and High School, I dedicated myself to three main
                        activities.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Scouting</h4>
                    Scouting taught me many valuable life lessons that help make me who I am today. As an Eagle
                    Scout, I planned and led a service project in my community with a team of 30 volunteers consisting
                    of friends, fellow scouts, and family. Scouting taught me many different principles, the most
                    valuable I think being servant leadership and how to be a good teammate.

                    <h4>Violin</h4>
                    My musical journey started in 6th grade, where picking up the violin would lead me to many
                    different opportunities. Learning, pracitcing, and rehearsing with different pieces of music every
                    couple of months helped me develop an ability to make changes on the fly, a skill I like to apply in
                    everything I do. At Texas A&M, if my schedule allows, I take the chance to be in the University
                    Philharmonic Orchestra where I continue to have fun making music with others.

                    <h4>Zen do Kai karate</h4>
                    Zen do Kai means "whatever works", meaning I got to learn not only karate, but self defense,
                    and elements and ideals from other martial arts. Here, I was able to push myself and kept on working
                    for 8 years to eventually become an adult black belt, meaning I learned how to approach dangerous
                    situations with peace in mind, how to push my limits, and how to be confident yet humble.
