    <p style="width: auto; height: auto">About me:<br>
        I am an aspiring Computer Engineer with a multifaceted background that includes being a violinist,
        skilled martial artist, 3d printer enthusiast, and an Eagle Scout. My first exposure to the intricacies
        of technology was building my first home office set up including upgrading a built PC. I've taken that
        interest with me to Texas A&M, where I now study more about computer architecture and design, as well as
        working in IT at the Texas A&M Foundation.
